Thanks for submitting an idea for improvement!

Tips to submit an enhancement that may be approved:

 - Well thought out ideas considering edge cases and API design will be more likely for someone to pursue.
 - We avoid breaking changes. If your feature results in a breaking change it won't be considered until a future major release.

 * \param context
 * Context for the callback function

 * \remarks
 * Capture is only of one type. At this point it is not linked to other captures. Capture is safe to use durring this
 * callback as the caller ensures a ref is held. If the callback function wants the capture to exist beyond this
 * callback, a ref must be taken with capture_inc_ref().

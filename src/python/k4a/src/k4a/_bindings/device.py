@mainpage Welcome

This documentation describes the Python API usage for the Azure Kinect Sensor
SDK.

For details about the Azure Kinect DK hardware and for more information about 
getting started with development please see https://azure.com/kinect.

@section api_languages API Languages
The Azure Kinect Sensor SDK is primarily a C API. This documentation covers the
Python wrapper extension to the API. For the most detailed documentation of API
behavior, see the documentation for the C functions that the Python classes 
wrap.

@section python_examples Examples
Refer to the Examples for example Python code to effectively use the Python 
API. Once the Python API package is installed, a simple "import k4a" will
give you access to all the classes and enums used in the API.

@example the_basics.py
@example image_transformations.py
@example simple_viewer.py

def set_logging_callback(callback_func:logging_message_cb, context_local, loglevel:ELogLevel)->EStatus:
    '''Register a python callback function to handle the logging of messages that are
    generated by the k4a library.

    The callback function must take the form of:
    
    callback_func(context_local, loglevel:ELogLevel, filename:str, line:int, message:str)

    where callback_func is the name of the function to pass to set_logger_callback.
    The callback must be annotated with '@k4a.logging_message_cb' to mark it as a
    callback function.
    
    The context_local is a Python object that is passed to the DLL, which is then passed back
    to the callback function. If the user does not need a context, use None. In the callback
    function, the context is passed in as the same Python object that is passed to the DLL.

    @note When using a context, the context object or instance must exist for the lifetime
    of the loaded DLL. As such, a global context object is usually used for the entire lifetime
    of the application.

    @code
    1. Callback function that ignores the context:

    # Define a callback function. The context argument will be ignored.
    @k4a.logging_message_cb
    def my_callback(context, loglevel:ELogLevel, filename:str, line:int, message:str):
        formattedStr = str(k4a.ELogLevel(level)) + " in " + str(src_file, 'UTF-8') + \
            " at line " + str(src_line) + ": " + str(message, 'UTF-8')
        print(formattedStr)

    # Pass the callback function to set_logger_callback. Pass None as the context.
    status = set_logger_callback(my_callback, None, ELogLevel.INFO)
    @endcode

    @code
    2. Callback function with context:

    # Define a context object.
    class LogContext:
        call_count = 0

        def get_call_count(self):
            retValue = self.call_count
            self.call_count = self.call_count + 1
            return retValue

    # Instantiate a global context.
    context = LogContext()

    # Define a callback function for logging. The context argument will be ignored.
    @k4a.logging_message_cb
    def logging_callback(context_local, loglevel:k4a.ELogLevel, src_filename:str, src_line:int, message:str):

        formattedStr = str()

        # Convert py_object to LogContext.
        if context_local is not None:
            formattedStr += str(context_local.get_call_count()) + " "
        
        formattedStr += str(k4a.ELogLevel(loglevel)) + " in " + str(src_filename, 'UTF-8') + " at line " + str(src_line) + ": " + str(message, 'UTF-8')
        print(formattedStr)

    # Pass the callback function to set_logger_callback.
    status = set_logger_callback(my_callback, context, ELogLevel.INFO)
    @endcode

    Args:
        callback_func ([function]): A callback function with a specific signature.
        context: The context associated with the callback function, if any.
        loglevel (ELogLevel): The level of logging to use.

    Returns:
        EStatus: Returns EStatus.SUCCEEDED if the callback function is successfully
            registered, or EStatus.FAILED otherwise.
